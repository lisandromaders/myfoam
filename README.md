# myfoam

This is my OpenFOAM working project ($WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR).

At the moment I am working in a solver called tccFoam, which refers to an implementation of a chemistry reduction technique called FGM (Flamelet-Generated-Manifold).

I will implement new transport and thermodynamics models to take mu, k, cp and rho values from table according to Zt (transport variable) field.


When it gets done I will put a better explanation together with usage and example cases....
